            title: 'The Megathrust',
            description: 'On January 26, 1700, the tectonic Pacific Plate abruptly slipped further beneath the Juan de Fuca Plate, causing a "megathrust" earthquake about 70 miles off the West Coast of Oregon. The quake, which geological evidence suggests was around 8.7 to 9.2 magnitude on the Richter scale, destroyed low lying settlements, dropped the coastline of Oregon by several feet, and created a tsunami that reached Japan. It was the last earthquake to occur on the 700 mile-long Cascadia Subduction Zone fault line. But seismologists say the next megathrust is coming due, with some simulations estimating a 37 percent chance it will occur in the next 50 years.',

The chemicals will create a toxic cloud that will likely spread across the Portland region. And the state's ability to respond to the compounding disasters will be severely limited. The CEI hub holds 90 percent of Oregon's fuel supply and 100 percent of the fuel supply for the Portland International Airport, meaning rescue operations and emergency vehicles will have to run on fuel shipped in expensively and inconveniently from out-of-state.",
